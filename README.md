### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Houston. My research focus is improving health, functional independence, and well-being in older adults at the [Cognitive Neuropsychology of Daily Life](https://www.uh.edu/class/psychology/clinical-psych/research/cndl/) Laboratory. The repositories contained herein relate to my undergraduate work, graduate work, and independent explorations.

You can find a more refined presentation of these projects on my [personal webpage](https://romeopenheiro.netlify.app)!
